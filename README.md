# RedToolBoxCLI_PythonWorkflow
This code takes a spreadsheet containing paths of drone flights (mavic M3E MS), a DGPS base station (reach RS2), their associated metadata, and outputs from base station PPK corrections (AusPos) and feeds this information into the RedCatch RedToolbox command line interface allowing EXIF coordinate corrections to be batch processed.
